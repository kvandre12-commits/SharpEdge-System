# SharpEdge Systems

SharpEdge Systems is a systematic market data and regime analysis engine focused on
clarity, discipline, and decision-quality over noise.

Built from a background in precision craft, this project applies the same principles
of sharp tools, clean structure, and deliberate execution to financial data:

- Automated multi-source market data ingestion (Alpaca, FINRA, FRED)
- Feature engineering and liquidity/regime classification
- Backtested signal generation with calibrated options execution logic
- Deterministic trade cards designed to reduce emotional decision-making

The goal is simple:

**Create a reliable edge through structure, not speculation.**

## Architecture Overview

Pipeline layers:

1. **Truth Layer** – Raw market data ingestion and normalization  
2. **Feature Layer** – Derived signals, regimes, and structural context  
3. **Decision Layer** – Backtested rules, calibrated DTE selection, and trade plans  

All processes are automated via scheduled workflows and reproducible SQLite state.

## Purpose

SharpEdge Systems is both:

- A personal discipline framework for systematic trading  
- A production-style data engineering portfolio project  

It represents the transition from physical precision craft → data system design.
